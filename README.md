# Assignment 14

### Overview

You will create a console project named `Client` with a reference to `Generator`. 

```text
Solution
 ├── Client (project reference to Generator)
 ├── Generator
 └── Generator.Tests
```

### The Generator

Using the `Image` class, call the `Generate()` method to create 1,000 new images in either the default folder `C:\ccu` or a custom folder path you provide. After this runs, you will have 1,000 new image files — this is the setup for the assignment. **Your task is to rearrange the files into a hierarchy.**  Think of this as a kind of utility to help organize photos — because that is exactly what you're building. Only instead of working with real photos, you're generating and organizing simple images using `Image.Generate()`.

### Example layout

```text
top_folder
 └── year
     ├── month
     │   ├── file
     │   └── file
     └── month
         └── file
```

Move the files into the correct folders, creating any folders that don't exist. When finished, there should be no images remaining in the `top_folder` or in any year folder — only in the appropriate month folders.

### Example result

```text
c:\ccu
└── 2024
    ├── 01
    │   ├── 2024-01-12.png
    │   └── 2024-01-14.png
    └── 02
        ├── 2024-02-02.png
        └── 2024-02-24.png
```

Pay attention to the details:

- The **year folder name** is the four-digit year (e.g., `2025`).
- The **month folder name** is the two-digit month (e.g., `01`, `12`).
- The **file name** is automatically generated by the `Image` class. Do **not** change it.

You can verify your logic by opening a few images and checking that their dates match their folders. You can determine the image's date by either parsing the file name or using the static `GetFileCreationUtc()` method in the `Image` class. Both approaches return the same date. In either case, the date value is the key to determining the correct folder path to move the file.

> **Be careful!** You are passing in a folder and have the potential to cause a real mess if you choose a folder you're using for something else. If you're not sure what folder to use, just accept the default: `C:\ccu`.

## File System References

These are some of the `Directory` and `File` methods you will need to employ for this assignment.

 * [Directory.CreateDirectory Method](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.directory.createdirectory?view=net-9.0)
 * [Directory.Exists Method](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.directory.exists?view=net-9.0)
 * [Directory.GetFiles Method](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.directory.getfiles?view=net-9.0)
 * [File.Move Method](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.file.move?view=net-9.0)

## Universal Acceptance Criteria

1. You must understand every single line of your solution.
2. Your code must compile and run without errors.
3. You must submit your repository URL in Brightspace.

## Assignment Requirements

Take care to make the console UI clean and professional. I'm not going to give you a mock-up this week, so you can enjoy the freedom to design it how you think is best. Remember, this is just a console — keep it simple, clear, and polished.

1. **Create your own branch!**
2. Create the `Console App` named `Client`.
3. Call `Generate()` with a `count` of 1,000.  

   > **Tip**: While developing, use fewer files so it runs faster.

4. Ask the user if they want to start `[y/n]`.
5. Rearrange images as described above.
6. When complete, open File Explorer to the root folder.  

   > **Tip**: You can find the root folder path in `Image.RootFolderPath`.

## Optional Bonus (20 points)

1. Display a [progress bar](https://spectreconsole.net/live/progress) in the console while working.
2. After the operation completes, report how many milliseconds elapsed.

**Good luck.**
